# Maze-Game
A maze game I made in 2020

### Goal of the game
Try to make it through the randomized maze to the top of the screen and touch the diamond. Each time you make it, gain a point and restart with a new maze. If you can't make it through the current maze, you can reshuffle to a different one.

### Future development
- Levels increasing in difficulty as points are won
